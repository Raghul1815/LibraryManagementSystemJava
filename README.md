# 📚 Library Management System (Core Java)

A **console-based Library Management System** developed using **Core Java** to practically apply Object-Oriented Programming principles and core Java concepts.

This project focuses on **clean design, validation, and real-world logic**, rather than UI or database integration.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- **Abstraction** – Implemented using an abstract `Student` class  
- **Inheritance** – `LibraryDetails` class extends `Student`  
- **Polymorphism** – Parent class reference holding child class object  
- **Encapsulation** – Internal data (book count) controlled through methods  

### 🔹 Core Java
- Classes & Objects  
- Constructors  
- Scanner for user input  
- switch-case for decision making  
- String handling  

### 🔹 Regex Validation
- Name validation (only alphabets allowed)  
- Register number validation (e.g., `7325-23CS094`)  

### 🔹 Exception Handling
- Custom exception (`InvalidInputException`)  
- Usage of `throw`, `throws`, `try-catch-finally`
